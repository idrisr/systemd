\chapter{Introduction}
Systemd is the unavoidable beast on Linux and NixOS. This is my attempt to
teach it to myself while producing a lasting artifact.

Systemd is PID~1, launched by the kernel and marking the entry to user space.
It manages a directed graph of \emph{units}, not just processes. Every process
has a parent, with systemd at the root of the user-space tree.

The nodes of this graph are units. Units are defined by unit files, collected
from known directories. Systemd parses them into a graph and executes it in
topological order, honoring dependencies while maximizing parallelism.

Some units spawn long-lived daemons, others represent timers, sockets, mounts,
targets, or devices. Systemd supervises them: processes may crash, and systemd
can restart them according to policy. It can also trigger units on events such
as socket activity, device appearance, path changes, timers, or D-Bus requests.

The process graph built by systemd contains many daemons listening on network
or Unix sockets. Systemd itself does not provide a discovery layer for these
services; DNS handles the network side, while D-Bus acts as the local discovery
and IPC bus.

\chapter{Units}
\section{Service}
Service units are the work-horse of systemd. Only within service units, we have
a type argument.

\begin{definition}{Templated Units}{}
  Templated units in \texttt{systemd} are unit files whose names contain an
  \texttt{@} symbol, such as \texttt{myservice@\{instance\}.service}. They define
  a generic structure that can be instantiated with specific identifiers. When an
  instance like \texttt{myservice@foo.service} is started, the placeholder is
  replaced with \texttt{foo}, and the unit can refer to this instance string using
  \texttt{\%i} (or \texttt{\%I} for the unescaped form). This enables modular,
  reusable configurations across services or users.
\end{definition}

\begin{intuition}{Templated Unit}{}
  A templated unit is essentially a $\lambda$-abstraction over a systemd unit
  file. Applying it with an instance name produces a concrete unit named
  \texttt{unit@\textit{instance}.service}, where \textit{instance} is the
  argument.
\end{intuition}

    \texttt{simple}  & Default. Start service and assume it's ready immediately.    \\
    \texttt{exec}    & Like \texttt{simple}, but tracks the real PID of the binary. \\
    \texttt{forking} & Assumes service forks; parent exits when setup is done.      \\
    \texttt{oneshot} & For short-lived commands (e.g. setup); blocks until done.    \\
    \texttt{notify}  & Waits for \texttt{READY=1} via \texttt{sd\_notify()}.        \\
    \texttt{dbus}    & Waits until service acquires a specific D-Bus name.          \\

\end{table}

Use notify when you want to control when the unit is considered started based on
your custom logic.

\section{Target}
\begin{definition}{Target}{}
  Targets are grouping units in systemd. They have no associated process;
  their only role is to aggregate other units for synchronization and
  dependency management.
\end{definition}

A target is considered active when all of its Requires= or Wants= are started
in the systemd sense---activating, active, or deactivating.

It doesn’t run code. It doesn't have a process. It just becomes active as soon
as the units it gathers are active.

\chapter{Unit Sections}
Every unit file is made up of sections. Different unit types will have different
subsets of the sections available, and some sections are available to all unit
types.

Each section is made up of different directives, which are key-value pair which
control how to the unit behaves. There are a ton of directives and sections, and
the tables below summarize the most common types of each you should know.

  \caption{Commonly used directives}
\end{table}

\begin{definition}{Service Section}{}
  Let $u \in U$ be a systemd unit of type \texttt{.service}.

  The \texttt{[Service]} section defines the **execution behavior** of $u$:
  a finite map
  \begin{align*}
    \text{Service} : K \to V
  \end{align*}
  where $K$ is a set of predefined keys (e.g. \texttt{ExecStart}, \texttt{Restart}),
  and $V$ are values interpreted by systemd at runtime.

  This section governs the transition behavior of the unit’s state predicate $\mathsf{started}(u)$,
  including:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item when and how the unit is started
    \item what process it runs
    \item what happens on failure
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Section}{}
  A logical partition of a systemd unit file in INI format. Each section
  groups related directives. Common sections include \texttt{[Unit]},
  \texttt{[Service]}, and \texttt{[Install]}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Unit}{}
  Generic metadata and dependency configuration. Typical directives:
  \texttt{Description=}, \texttt{Wants=}, \texttt{Requires=}, \texttt{After=}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Install}{}
  Defines how the unit integrates into the system when enabled or disabled.
  Most commonly uses \texttt{WantedBy=} or \texttt{RequiredBy=}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Service}{}
  Controls how a service (daemon or process) is started, stopped, and
  restarted. Key directives: \texttt{ExecStart=}, \texttt{ExecStop=},
  \texttt{Restart=}, \texttt{User=}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Socket}{}
  Configures socket activation, where systemd listens on a socket and
  activates the matching service on demand. Common directives:
  \texttt{ListenStream=}, \texttt{ListenDatagram=}, \texttt{SocketMode=}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Timer}{}
  Schedules units based on time or activity. Directives include
  \texttt{OnCalendar=}, \texttt{OnBootSec=}, \texttt{OnUnitActiveSec=}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{directive}{}
  A single key--value instruction inside a unit section. Directives tell
  systemd how to configure or control behavior. For example,
  \texttt{Description=}, \texttt{ExecStart=}, and \texttt{WantedBy=} are
  directives. Each section has its own set of valid directives, and
  systemd ignores unknown ones.

\chapter{Design Patterns}
\section{If This Then That}
Many systemd units follow an *if-then* structure, where the *then* is a
\texttt{.service} unit, and the *if* is an event unit. Common event types include
\texttt{.path} (file changes), \texttt{.mount} (mount state changes),
\texttt{.socket} (socket activation), \texttt{.timer} (scheduled time),
and \texttt{.device} (hardware changes). These trigger the corresponding
service via the \texttt{Unit=} directive.
